ADD YOUR MUSIC HERE
===================

To add background music to your confession site:

1. Find a romantic MP3 file you want to use
2. Rename it to "romantic.mp3"
3. Place it in this folder (public/audio/)

The music will play when the user clicks "Play with Music" at the start.

Recommended: Use royalty-free romantic music to avoid copyright issues.
